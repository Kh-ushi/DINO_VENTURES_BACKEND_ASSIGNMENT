The previously shared Vercel URL (through google form) was a preview deployment link. Preview URLs can change across deployments, so for stable evaluation I recommend using the production deployment below:

Frontend: https://dino-ventures-backend-assignment.vercel.app

Backend: https://dino-wallet.duckdns.org

Both environments are fully functional and connected over HTTPS.
